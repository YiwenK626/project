							<h1>CO<sub>2</sub> Avoidance Cost Analysis of Replacing Retired Fossil-Fuel Plants in North Carolina</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/COAflow.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
							<p> Department of Environmental Quality in North Carolina released
								the Clean Energy Plan in 2019 to significantly reduce greenhouse
								gas over the next decade. This plan sets goals for the electric
								power sector to achieve a 70% reduction by 2030 below the 2005
								level and to realize carbon neutrality by 2050 (NCDEQ, 2019). A
								talk presented in a local public radio given by Billy Pizer, a
								professor from Duke University, mentioned that the earlier North
								Carolina transit to renewable energy, the more benefits that people
								will gain in the future (Magus, et al., 2019). To quantitively
								evaluate this opinion, an Excel model is built to analyze whether
								a lower CO2 Avoidance Cost can be attained if North Carolina takes
								earlier actions to replace retired fossil fuel power plants with
								renewable ones. Solar plants with PV generators are used as an
								example for renewable energy plants, while NGCC plants are set as
								the default choice if not using renewable energy.
								<p>This model evaluated the difference between three scenarios in
									CO2 Avoidance Cost, i.e. increase in cost over the decrease in
									GHG emissions. These three scenarios differ in the starting point
									of replacing retired fossil fuel plants with solar plants. The
									results show that adopting solar plants in earlier periods will
									result in a relatively higher CO2 Avoidance Cost. However, if CO2
									tax is taken into consideration, earlier replacement with solar
									plants will have prominent financial benefits. The data source of
									this model is supplied by eGrid2016 (EPA, 2018) and 2019 Annual
									Technology Baseline (ATB) from NREL (NREL, 2019). </p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/stages.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								According to generation data collected from eGrid2016, power plants
								in North Carolina with oil, natural gas, and coal as primary fuel
								 will have a retirement cycle of about 10 years if assuming an
								 average 30-year lifespan (Figure 2). The retirement stages are
								 2020-2030, 2030-2040 and 2040-2050 respectively (namely Phase 1,
								 2 and 3). This indicates that in the future decades, North Carolina
								 will need to replace those retired conventional power plants with
								 new plants to satisfy the state’s electricity demand. </p>
							<h2>Assumptions</h2>
							<p>This model is built based on four assumptions which are made with
								regard to lifespan of present fossil fuel plants, the electricity
								demand of the state, alternatives for retired plants replacement,
								and fuel price:</p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/trend.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<ol>
								<li>Life Span: the average life span for fossil fuel plants is assumed to be 30 years.</li>
								<li>Electricity Demand: Electricity demand in North Carolina is
									assumed to remain at a stable level in the future decades according
									to historical data (Figure 1). Thus, the capacity of plants to
									be built is assumed to be equal to that of the retired plants. </li>
								<li>Alternatives: The retired plants will be renewed as natural
									gas plants (NGCC) without carbon capture system if renewable
									strategies are not taken; otherwise, those natural gas plants
									will be replaced with renewable power plants; in this case,
									technical specifications of a typical solar plant are used as
									an example in calculations. </li>
								<li>Fuel Price: Natural gas prices in the US will remain at the
									present level for future decades.</li>
							</ol>
							<h2>Method</h2>
							<p>Information about plants currently online in North Carolina is
								obtained from eGrid2016. The information includes primary fuel
								type, net annual generation and generator online year. Fossil
								fuel-fired plants are filtered by primary fuel types as natural
								gas, coal, and oil. With an assumption of an average lifespan of
								30 years, the retirement year of fossil fuel-fired power plants
								are calculated. Those fossil fuel plants can be categorized by
								retirement year into three 10-year phases from 2020 to 2050.
							<p>Three scenarios of replacing retired plants with solar plants,
								i.e. Phase 1, 2 and 3, are discussed in a time range of 2040-2060.
								The operation length will be 30, 20 and 10 years respectively
								for the plants built in the three phases. Once being built,
								power plants will not be replaced within the time range of this
								model. </p>
							<p>The specifications and parameters of a typical NGCC plant (Table
								1) and a solar plant are used as proxies for the calculation.
								The total cost and CO2 emission of the scenario where all retired
								plants are replaced with NGCC plants are taken as a baseline in
								order to calculate CO2 Avoidance Cost in the range of 2030 to 2060.
								For NGCC plants, the cost is consisted of fuel cost and capital
								cost, while for solar plants, the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)
								is used directly to calculate the total cost (Figure 3). CO2 Avoidance Cost
								is calculated through the equation as:
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/equation.jpg" alt=""/></span></p>
							<p>The inputs of solar plants are considered flexibly in the model.
								The value of life cycle GHG emissions rate can be changed from
								0 – 100 kg/MWh, where 0 represents LCA is not taken into
								consideration. For the LCOE cost of solar plants, the value can
								be changed from $30/MWh to $55/MWh according to the data of real
								solar farms in the ATB database. Though the LCOE costs listed
								in ATB have negligible variation with time of 30 years, the
								constant LCOE cost used for calculation in the model should be
								interpreted as an average value through the lifespan. Moreover,
								CO2 tax can be chosen with a range from $0/tons to $50/tons to
								discuss various scenarios. </p>

							<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/result1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>From the results in Figure 4, it can be concluded that replacing
								retired plants with solar plants in an earlier stage will lead to
								higher marginal GHG reduction costs if emission tax and LCA emission
								are not considered. The CO2 Avoidance Cost in Phase 1 is
								approximately 4 times higher than that in Phase 3. It indicates
								that when no emission penalty like CO2 tax is required for power
								plants, even though solar power plants are at a low-cost level and
								LCA emissions are not considered, an earlier action to adopt
								renewable energy will not result in lower marginal GHG emission
								reduction cost.
							</p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/result2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Figure 5 shows the model output with emission tax as $10/tons,
								LCA emission rate of solar plants as 55kg CO2/MWh and LCOE cost
								of solar plants as $55/MWh. Those values are chosen as a
								representation of normal conditions. The results show that after
								inducing emission tax, CO2 Avoidance Cost in three phases all
								increase greatly. In this case, an earlier action to replace retired
								plants with solar plants will result in lower CO2 Avoidance Cost.
							</p>
							<p>According to the model outputs in two scenarios discussed above,
								it can be concluded that when emission tax is induced, an earlier
								action to adopt renewable energy plants will bring financial
								benefits compared with conventional natural gas plants. The
								results presented by the scenario without emission tax and LCA
								emission are not opposed to the potential benefits of renewable
								energy because this model does not evaluate the loss from
								environmental damage. It should also be noted that risks brought
								by extreme weather, transmission limits and siting limits will
								increase the complexity of cost analysis of renewable energy.
								Instead, the discussion of this model is limited when CO2 Avoidance
								Cost is taken as the measurement. </p>
