							<h1>CO2 Avoidance Cost Analysis of Replacing Retired Fossil-Fuel Plants in North Carolina</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/COAflow.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p> As a feasibility analysis of North Carolina’s Clean Energy Plan
								published by Department of Environmental Quality, this model briefly
								evaluated the difference in marginal cost of reducing GHG emissions,
								i.e. increase in cost over decrease in GHG emissions, if North Carolina
								starts to replace retired plants with renewable power plants at
								earlier or later time. A typical NGCC and a solar plant are used
								as examples to compare 3 ways in their cost of reducing GHG
								emissions in 2060. The results of the model show that though
								adopting solar plants in earlier period will result in higher
								marginal cost, their difference is small, which can make renewable
								energy plants as a promising alternative considering their
								environmental advantages. This model is based on data of present
								operating plants in North Carolina obtained from eGrid2016 and ATB. </p>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/stages.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								North Carolina recently released a plan to significantly reduce
								 greenhouse gases from electricity production over the next decade.
								 The goal in electricity production sector is to get to zero emissions
								 by 2050 as well as a 60 to 70% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030.
								 In the conservation between Frank Stasio and Professor Pizer
								 from Duke University, they mentioned that though cost of electricity
								 for people in North Carolina will increase, the earlier we transit
								 to renewable energy the better we will benefit in the future.
								 It is clear that if we start earlier,  then higher percentage
								 of renewable energy plants will have in the future. This model
								 is designed to evaluate in electricity production sector, whether
								 we will have lower marginal cost to reduce GHG emissions if
								 we start to replace retired fossil fuel fired plants with
								 renewable ones earlier. Solar plants with PV generators are used
								  as an example for renewable energy plants, while NGCC plants
									are set as the default choice for not using renewable energy. </p>
							<h2>Assumptions</h2>
							<ol>
								<li>US’s natural gas price will remain at the present level for the future decades. </li>
								<li>No technologies breakthrough in PV industries is taken into consideration. </li>
								<li>Assuming the average life span for fossil fuel plans is 30 years.</li>
								<li>If renewable energy plants are not used, the retired plants will be renewed as natural gas plants. </li>
								<li>Electricity demand in North Carolina will remain a stable level in the future decades. </li>
							</ol>
							<h2>Results and Conclusions</h2>
							<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/results.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<p>From the results in the chart, we can see replacing more retired
								plants with solar plants will lead to higher marginal GHG reduction
								cost. Period 1 is approximately 2.3 times of the second and the
								second is about 1.7 times of the third. But cost between the three
								approaches are close. As I didn’t involve the environmental loss
								caused by higher GHG emissions, starting using solar plants at
								Period 1 still have potential advantages, which will make renewable
								energy as promising alternatives if proper legislations are conducted.
